Problem setting:
Target group: renowned brands

Problem statement: 
-Issue: "out-of-stock" situation, leading to lost sales for retailers and disappointment for in-storre shoppers
-Method of solving: develop an inventory system which allows staff to manage and record commodity inventory in different retail shops for monitoring inventory status, reduces time for managing inventory by keeping records in place, and improves delivery by managing stock-outs and meeting customer expections.
-Vision: The system allows renowned brands to control and manage the ordering and storage of inventory, which helps optimizing the management process
-Features of the system:
1) Search commodity according to different filters (e.g. in-stock/out-of-stock)
2) Insert new commodity with basic information (name, manufacturer, amount, price, availability of shop(s)) after eachh procurement
3) Delete obsolete commodity
4) Update commodity information
5) Automatic change of inventory status according to the amount of commodity that is currently available (e.g. when the amount reaches zero, the inventory status would become "out-of-stock")
6) Deliver alerts when the commodity is "out-of-stock"
